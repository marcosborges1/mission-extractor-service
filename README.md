# Mission Extractor (ME)

## Overview

The Mission Extractor (ME) is a component for extracting and organizing files that describe missions, especially those employing languages capable of expressing structural and behavioral properties in dynamic software architectures to a more general and readable format such as JSON.

The essence of ME's functionality is rooted in the [Algorithm section](#Algorithm).

## Algorithm

The ME's core is based on the algorithm described below.

## Implementation Details

Constructed using Python, the ME service is a lightweight, dynamic, and web-compatible solution. The choice of language complements the ME algorithm's versatility and caters to the overarching requirements of the System of Systems context.

## Setup

Before running the application, make sure to install the required dependencies. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Before you start the ME, be sure to start it.

```bash
python server.py
```

Access the ME from the GraphQL endpoint:

```bash
http://localhost:4001/graphql
```

**Note**:

- The default PORT is _4001_, but can be change for your convenience.
- This project heavily relies on GraphQL, a powerful query language for APIs, and a server-side runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. If you're unfamiliar with GraphQL or wish to dive deeper, you can [learn more about GraphQL here](https://graphql.org/).
